Ladies and gentlemen, as we start our descent, please make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright position. 
Make sure your seat belt is securely fastened and all carry-on luggage is stowed underneath the seat in front of you or in the overhead bins. 
Please turn off all electronic devices until we are safely parked at the gate. 
Thank you.
