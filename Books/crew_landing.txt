Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our destination. 
Local time is ten fifteen  and the temperature is 20 degrees celsius.
For your safety and comfort, please remain seated with your seat belt fastened until the Captain turns off the Fasten Seat Belt sign. 
This will indicate that we have parked at the gate and that it is safe for you to move about.
Please check around your seat for any personal belongings you may have brought on board with you and please use caution when opening the overhead bins, as heavy articles may have shifted around during the flight.
If you require deplaning assistance, please remain in your seat until all other passengers have deplaned.
One of our crew members will then be pleased to assist you.
We remind you to please wait until you are inside the terminal to use any electronic devices. 
On behalf of the captain and the entire crew, I’d like to thank you for joining us on this trip and we are looking forward to seeing you on board again in the near future. 
Have a nice day.
