The checklists provided here were made using two of the excellent simulator checklists of  

Werner Schott, Switzerland, w.schott@abbts.ch

In the main Books directory, we have ATR 42-500 checklists, and in the LJ45 subdirectory there is 
a collection of Learjet 45 checklists.

You will have to split up the PDF files into the standard text files using a PDF reader 
and a conventional text editor.  


--------------------------------------------


In order to load the correct checklists for the correct aircraft, please store the checklists (do not rename the files) 
in a subdirectory within the "Books" directory. 

The name of the subdirectory must correspond to the aircraft model type parameter. 
This is very important: Choose the same name as defined in FSX's aircraft.cfg (atc_model) or use the 
second parameter as defined in fspilot.ini for the aircraft. 

---------------------------------------------


Example:

in fspilot.ini you have 

ac12=Beech Baron 58,BE58,110,145,150,90,4,1000,0,3,4,5,15,25

for the Beech Baron 58. 

The 'model type'is the second parameter -> 'BE58'

Make a subdirectory 'BE58' in your 'Books' folder and copy all checklist text files into that directory. 
Update the text of the files with suitable information for the Baron. 

Done !
