If you experience connection problems while running FSXPilot together with FSX, P3D or FSX Steam edition please consider changing the SimConnect.dll in FSXPilot's main directory.
By default, you find the RTM SimConnect DLL installed.
From here you also find DLL's for FSX SP1 and FSX Acceleration pack.
Close FSXPilot. 
Just overwrite the SimConnect.dll in FSXPilot's home directory and restart FSXPilot.
